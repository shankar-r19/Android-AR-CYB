This file tracks things that would be nice to add to this project.

# Write documentation for existing features
* Websocket connection to ESP32
* File transfer
* Calibration on multiplayer

# Add new features
* Motion paths UI editing
* Electron paths finish the plugin

# Optimize
* OvrAvatar and Oculus integration are probably not needed, but they use up lots of space & build time. Figure out how to remove them.

# Investigate
* Use Unity package manager to link to existing packages such as MRTK, Photon (will have issues with versions?)

# Known Bugs
* Arduino often doesn't receive data properly from Unity. Might be a threading issue, or problem with the Arduino receiving code. Sending is fine.
